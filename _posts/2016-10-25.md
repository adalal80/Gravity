## A Classification Analysis of Titanic Survivors

This project examines the probability of survival in the Titanic disaster using Classification models. Several models will be evaluated, such as Logistic, Gridsearch using Logistic, KNN, and Decision Trees. The dataset is accessed via a remote database, in which Exploratory Data Analysis is performed to select the features used in the models.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

The following features are categorical variables: Pclass and Sex.
Age is a continuous variable, are binned into Child, Teenage, Young Adult, Adult, and Senior groups, thus categorical variables. Fare (see histogram below) will be normalized as it is skewed. Sibsp and Parch will be used as continuous variables.


### Model Validation



#### Logistic Regression
Confusion Matrix
| 			   |not_survived | survived |     
|--------------|-------------|----------| 
| not_survived |     126     |    20    | 
| survived     |      31     |    57    | 


Model - Score: 0.78205
F1 Score     : 0.6909

#### Gridsearch with Logistic Regression
Confusion Matrix
| 			   |not_survived | survived |
