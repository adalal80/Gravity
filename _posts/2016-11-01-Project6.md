## Predicting Movie Ratings from IMDB Top 250

What factors determine a high-rating for a movie? This analysis investigated the features of what makes a good movie (high rating). Since the access rights to movies do cost companies like Netflix, it is important that they select movies that their users want to watch, otherwise, they might shift to competitors.
The intent is to use features from IMDB api to evaluate the movie's rating. For this portion, top 250 movies will be used to determine feature importance and its predicting power using tree-based models, such as Decision Trees, Random Trees, and Extra Trees.

### Data

The data was collected by IMDBpie, a Python API for IMDB. Features used in the analysis were:
1) Runtime
2) Budget - indicates blockbuster and also a proxy for production company size
3) Season Released
4) Drama Genre
5) Oscar win
6) Oscar nominated


### Results

Runtime and Budget were the two most important features. Using cross val scores for Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Extra Trees, the best model yielded Decision Trees, followed by Random Forest.

The F1-Score and precision score (predicting high rating given it was a high rated movie) for Decision Trees were: 68% and 67%. The same scores for Random Forests were 62% and 58%.

### Conclusion

This analysis investigated the features of what makes a good movie (high rating). Since the access rights to movies do cost companies like Netflix, it is important that they select movies that their users want to watch, otherwise, they might shift to competitors.

The analysis here was not robust enough, as more than top250 movies are needed to determine whether the features can predict the movie rating. There are some unobservables such as plot. One can assume that being nominated for awards is a decend indicator, but there are observations of movies that are blockbusters, but have not been nominated or won an Oscar.

Collecting more data should improve this model and thus predict whether a movie will have a high rating. One note to point out is that we need to include which movies are on netflix and other streaming site, as that would increase the number of sources that a movie could be watched. Also ratings might be biased, as it could be only certain type of people would take time to rate a movie.
